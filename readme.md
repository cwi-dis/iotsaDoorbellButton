# Various iotsa projects

This repo is mainly for things that will eventually go into iotsa itself, or into self-contained repos, or fade away.

## iotsaDoorbellRinger

A buzzer server: you can tell it to make a buzzer sound for some time, and a LED light up.

Primarily used to experiment with tokens and capabilities for access control.

Requires _ArduinoJson_ library (install through the Library Manager) and _ArduinoJWT_ (install forked version from  <https://github.com/jackjansen/ArduinoJWT>).

## iotsaDoorbellButton

Related to previous one. Server for a device with a push button and a keyswitch, used to indirectly control _iotsaDoorbellRinger_.

Requires _ArduinoJson_ library (install through the Library Manager) and _ArduinoJWT_ (install forked version from  <https://github.com/jackjansen/ArduinoJWT>).
